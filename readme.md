## Commander X16 Retro Space Shoot-Em Up Game

Welcome to my first Commander X16 project! This project is a learning exercise where I am diving into assembly language programming to create a retro-style space shoot-em up game. The game is being developed for the Commander X16, a modern 8-bit computer inspired by the classic computers of the 1980s.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the nostalgic feel of classic space shoot-em up games. The game features a spaceship that the player can control to navigate through space, avoiding obstacles and enemies while aiming to achieve a high score.

## Features

- **Retro Graphics**: Utilizing the New Retro Commander X16 VERA chip to render sprites and backgrounds.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Move the spaceship using the WASD or cursor keys.
- **joystick Controls**: Implement an SNES controller as another method to control the spacehip
- **Assembly Language**: Written in assembly language for an authentic retro programming experience.
