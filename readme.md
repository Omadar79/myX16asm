## Commander X16 Project

Welcome to my first Commander X16 project! This project is a learning exercise where I am diving into assembly language to create a retro-style space shoot-em-up game. The game is being developed for the Commander X16, a modern 8-bit computer inspired by the classic computers of the 1980s. If it goes well, I might port it to other 6502-based systems like the Commodore 64 and/or the NES

### Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the nostalgic feel of a classic, vertical scrolling, space shooter game. The game features a spaceship that the player can control to navigate through space, avoiding obstacles, and shooting enemies while aiming to achieve a high score.  

If I can get the basic shooting mechanics locked in, I want add powerups and usable items, boss battles, story exposition via radio communication, and eventually even a level or progression selection map similar to Super Mario Bros 3 or Bionic Commando.

### Features

- **Retro Graphics**: Utilizing the New Retro Commander X16 VERA chip to render sprites and backgrounds.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Move the spaceship using the WASD or cursor keys.
- **joystick Controls**: Implement an SNES controller as another method to control the spaceship
- **Assembly Language**: Written in assembly language for an authentic retro programming experience.
